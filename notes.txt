1. Run proto file -
    protoc --go_out=. --go-grpc_out=. common.proto


when proposer sends the prepared message, it waits for the promise from majority of nodes. Check how to
implement this, proposer only needs to check the ballot number or the accepted val when majority nodes have sent
the promise


if leader is sending a prepare message, it might need to send the previous ballot number (last log that you
committed) - it becomes easier for other to accept? Can use linked list here? Current node, and the next
node (new stuff)

This system will work both ways. Leader will update followers, and followers will also update leader.
