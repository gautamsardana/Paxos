1. Run proto file -
    protoc --go_out=. --go-grpc_out=. common.proto


when proposer sends the prepared message, it waits for the promise from majority of nodes. Check how to
implement this, proposer only needs to check the ballot number or the accepted val when majority nodes have sent
the promise


if leader is sending a prepare message, it might need to send the previous ballot number (last log that you
committed) - it becomes easier for other to accept? Can use linked list here? Current node, and the next
node (new stuff)

This system will work both ways. Leader will update followers, and followers will also update leader.


If you are a slow server and you want to send out a prepare, include the current ballot number + the
ballot number of the last committed message in the prepare.
If the last committed message is outdated, you have a new synchronize API to update your ballot number
and commit new txns which other servers have already committed. Once this is done, try the prepare again.

If you are a slow user, and someone else sends you a prepare that you realise has last committed as something
that you dont have, you need to ask that server for new transactions. Send another sync request,
wait for the response and then commit all those transactions. Can we make this synchronous? Should we?

Future -
Add created_at, updated_at time so that we know what the order of all txns is.

transaction has already been committed or rolled back
